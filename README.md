# custom_audio
Hopefully the provided files give a clearer idea to the original at simpsons2_audio

# notes
- You cannot have a "wavepack" named GTAIV it seems like the game will unload the audio immediately. (this is why it is gtaiv_base)
- I combined all the speech into "player_speech" because there is a limit with how many speech_data files can be loaded (i dont know the exact amount)
