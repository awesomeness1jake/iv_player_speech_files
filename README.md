# iv_player_speech_files
Custom speech for GTA V / FiveM.

- If you want to use this, you need to export the audio from GTAIV.
- No facial animations were included as that is a nightmare to figure out and "automate".
- "NIKO" is the combined audio of "NIKO_01-15"
- "JOHNNY" is the combined audio of "JOHNNY_01-15"
- "LUIS" is the combined audio of "LUIS_01-15"

# notes
- I combined all the speech data into "player_speech" and I have provided some of the individual ones.
